This is a simple binding to the canonical LZO compression library. To compile
first make sure you have both liblzo2 and the headers installed (on Ubuntu you
can install the packages `liblzo2' and `liblzo2-dev'), then run the command
`python setup.py build && python setup.py install'.

Please note that this is my first Python/C interfacing code so be careful :-)
